 Sometimes it is useful to mount a Samba share to a directory so that the files in the directory can be treated as if they are part of the local file system.
To mount a Samba share to a directory, create create a directory to mount it to (if it does not already exist), and execute the following command as root:

mount -t cifs -o <username>,<password> //<servername>/<sharename> /mnt/point/

This command mounts <sharename> from <servername> in the local directory /mnt/point/. For more information about mounting a samba share, refer to man mount.cifs

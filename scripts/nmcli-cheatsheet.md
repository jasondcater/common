## Description
nmcli is a tool that allows NetworkManager management from command line.

## NetworkManager status

Display overall status of NetworkManager
`$ nmcli general status`

Display active connections
`$ nmcli connection show --active`

Display all configured connections
`$ nmcli connection show configured`

## Connect/disconnect to an already configured connection

Connect to a configured connection by name
`$ nmcli connection up id <connection name>`

Disconnection by name
`$ nmcli connection down id <connection name>`

## Wifi
Get Wifi status
`$ nmcli radio wifi`

Turn wifi on or off
`$ nmcli radio wifi <on|off>`

List available access points(AP) to connect to
`$ nmcli device wifi list`

Refresh previous list
`$ nmcli device wifi rescan`

Create a new connection to an open AP
`$ nmcli device wifi connect <SSID|BSSID>`

Create a new connection to a password protected AP
`$ nmcli device wifi connect <SSID|BSSID> password <password>`

## Network interfaces
List available devices and their status
`$ nmcli device status`

Disconnect an interface
`$ nmcli device disconnect iface <interface>`

## Create or modify a connection

To create a new connection using an interactive editor
`$ nmcli connection edit con-name <name of new connection>`

To edit an already existing connection using an interactive editor
`$ nmcli connection edit <connection name>`

## Example/Tutorial

Let's create a new connection
`$ nmcli connection edit con-name <name of new connection>`

It will ask us to define a connection type
```
$ Valid connection types: 802-3-ethernet (ethernet), 802-11-wireless (wifi), wimax, gsm, cdma, infiniband, adsl, bluetooth, vpn, 802-11-olpc-mesh (olpc-mesh), vlan, bond, team, bridge, bond-slave, team-slave, bridge-slave
Enter connection type: 
```

In this example we will use ethernet
`$ Enter connection type: ethernet`

Next this will appear, note that "nmcli>" is a prompt and that it lists the main settings available
```
$ ===| nmcli interactive connection editor |===

Adding a new '802-3-ethernet' connection

Type 'help' or '?' for available commands.
Type 'describe [<setting>.<prop>]' for detailed property description.

You may edit the following settings: connection, 802-3-ethernet (ethernet), 802-1x, ipv4, ipv6
nmcli> 
```

We will edit the setting "ipv4"
`$ nmcli> goto ipv4`

Note that after this our promt has changed to this to indicate that we are currently editing the "ipv4" setting
`$ nmcli ipv4>`

List available properties under the setting "ipv4" and describe the property "method"
`$ nmcli ipv4> describe`
`$ Available properties: method, dns, dns-search, addresses, routes, ignore-auto-routes, ignore-auto-dns, dhcp-client-id, dhcp-send-hostname, dhcp-hostname, never-default, may-fail
Property name?`
`$ Property name? method`

Let's set property "method" to "auto"
`$ nmcli ipv4> set method auto`

Now that we have finished editing the "ipv4" setting let's go back to the main level. Execute the following command until the prompt looks like this "nmcli>"
`$ nmcli> back`

If you need to list again the main settings use the "goto" command without any arguments. After that just press enter and ignore the error.
`$ nmcli> goto`
`$ Available settings: connection, 802-3-ethernet (ethernet), 802-1x, ipv4, ipv6
Setting name?`

It is possible to set a value for a property directly from the main level
`$ nmcli> set <setting>.<property> <value>`

For example
`$ nmcli> set connection.autoconnect TRUE`
`$ nmcli> set connection.interface-name <interface name this connection is bound to>`
`$ nmcli> set ethernet.cloned-mac-address <Spoofed MAC address>`

Finally check the connection details, save and exit
`$ nmcli> print`
`$ nmcli> save`
`$ nmcli> quit`

## Manually editing

To manually edit a ifcfg connection configuration open or create with a text editor the configuration file of the connection located in "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<connection name>"

A description of most common configuration options is available at:
http://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-networkscripts-interfaces.html

To modify a connection password open with a text editor and edit the file "keys-<connection id>" located in "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/". The password is stored in plain text. For example
`$ $ cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/keys-<connection name>
WPA_PSK='password'`

Or if using keyfile, simply edit the connection file located inside "/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/"

Finally save the files and to apply changes to an already active connection execute
`$ nmcli connection up id <connection name>`

## Delete a connection configuration

Delete the connection
`$ nmcli connection delete id <connection name>`

Please note this also deactivates the connection.

= Documentation for NetworkManager Command Line Interface nmcli =

The primary reference for nmcli are the manual pages nmcli(1) and nmcli-examples(5).
For a quick reference, the user can type `nmcli [help]` to print the supported options and commands.
The help parameter can also be used to obtain a more detailed description for the individual commands.
For example `nmcli connection help` and `nmcli connection add help` show a description for the possible connection operations and for how to add connections, respectively.

The newest version of the manual page can be found on [https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/unstable/nmcli.html nmcli](1) and [https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/unstable/nmcli-examples.html nmcli-examples](7).

## Notes

nmcli maybe contain some bugs and lack some features graphical tools for NetworkManager have.

To see all available options for your version of nmcli
`$ info nmcli`
